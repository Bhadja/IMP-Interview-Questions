Question: What is the difference between static synchronized and synchronized methods?
Ans: Static synchronized methods synchronize on the class object. If one thread is executing a
static synchronized method, all other threads trying to execute any static synchronized methods 
will be blocked.

Non-static synchronized methods synchronize on this ie the instance of the class. If one
thread is executing a synchronized method, all other threads trying to execute any synchronized 
methods will be blocked.
