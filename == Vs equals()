Difference between heap and string pool memory: (Source: http://www.coderanch.com/t/390447/java/java/Difference-Heap-Pool)

Heap:
The heap is just the area of RAM that is allotted to the JVM by the operating system for runtime activity. 
As such it is the place that objects get created during a JVM session. 

Pool:
Pool is a separate portion WITHIN the heap memory. This separate portion of heap memory is called "POOL"
The 'pool' is just a special area of the heap memory that Java sets up to store all String literals.
Imagine a box with a partition wall; on one side is the 'pool' on the other side the 'heap'. 
Everytime you use a string literal, it gets stored on the pool side, regular objects get stored on
the heap side.


Difference between HEAP memory and STACK memory
All objects are stored on the heap(including their attributes) memory.
Local variables of functions/methods(including method arguments) always contain primitive values or references and are stored on the stack memory.

The == (double equals) returns true, if the variable reference points to the same object in memory. 
This is called “shallow comparison”.

The equals() method calls the user implemented equals() method, which compares the object attribute values. 
The equals() method provides “deep comparison” by checking if two objects are logically equal as opposed to
the shallow comparison provided by the operator ==.

If equals() method does not exist in a user supplied class then the inherited Object class's equals() method 
will be called which evaluates if the references point to the same object in memory. In this case, the object.
equals() works just like the "==" operator.
