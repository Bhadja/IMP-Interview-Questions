Interfaces:
a) Cannot be instantiated
b) All attributes(data members and not methods) are "public static final"
3) All methods are "public abstract" (and not static and neither final)
4) Each and every method dont have a defination
5) Classes which implement the Interface have to define the abstract methods
6) By default, ALL METHODS in an interface are decleared as public, abstract. It will never be static.


Abstract Classes:
1) Cannot be instantiated
2) Methods can have defination. Some of the methods can be defined while some of the methods can be abstract.
   However an abstract class can have NO abstract methods. Even if a class does not have abstract methods but 
   is declared as abstract is said to be an abstract class.
3) We have to explicitly declare the abstract methods as "public abstract" so that they can be defined by the
   classes which inherit the abstract class.
4) Abstract classes fall in between "Interfaces" and proper actual defined "Classes" since they have both the
   properties.
5) A normal class cannot have abstract methods. If a method in a normal class is declared as abstract, then the
   whole class has to be declared as abstract. Otherwise compilation and runtime error would take place.
