Black-box test 
Fuzz test

Mutation test: 
Fault-based Testing: directed towards “typical” faults that could occur in a program
• Basic idea: – Take a program and test data generated for that program
– Create a number of similar programs (mutants), each differing from the original in one small way, i.e., each
 possessing a fault • e.g., replace addition operator by multiplication operator
– The original test data are then run through the mutants
– If test data detect all differences in mutants, then the mutants are said to bedead, and the test set isadequate

Question 2: Which of the following guarantees that you have exhaustively unit-tested a piece of code? 
a. 100% C0 (statement) coverage 
b. 100% C1 (branch) coverage 
c. 100% C2 (path) coverage 
d. None of the above

Answer: None of the above. Testing is hard. 
You could have tried every path, but not with every set of input values.
