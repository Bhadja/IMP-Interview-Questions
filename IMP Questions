2 SUM Problem

The 2 sum problem is a classic variation of the subset sum problem. It is defined as the following: 
You have an unsorted array, and you are given a value S. Find all pairs of elements in the array that
add up to value S. 
2 solutions - one minimizes space complexity, and the other time. As stated in the "hint", 
one approach is to hash the entire array, and then for each element check if S-array[j] is in the 
hash table. This takes O(n) time and O(n) space to store the array. 
Alternatively, if one wishes to minimize space complexity, simply sort the array. Then, have two
pointers - one initialized to array[0] and the other array[length-1]. Then check the sums; if the
sum is > S, decrement the right pointer. If it is < S, increment the left pointer.

Sample Java code for the second method of finding 2sum:
public static void findTwoSum(int[] A, int x) {
    Arrays.sort(A);        
    int start = 0;
    int end = A.length - 1;
    boolean found = false;
    while (!found && start < end) {
        if (A[start] + A[end] == x)
            found = true;
        else if (A[start] + A[end] > x)
            end--;
        else if (A[start] + A[end] < x)
            start++;
    }
    if (found)
        System.out.println("Sum " + x
                + " is found, values the making sum are " + A[start] + " , "
                + A[end]);
    else
        System.out.println("No pair exists whose sum is " + x);
}

To reverse a string in Java:

package BST_Demo;

public class ReverseArray {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	String givenString = "Am I bad ? ";
			StringBuilder reverse=new StringBuilder(givenString.length());
			for(int i=givenString.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
				reverse.append(givenString.charAt(i));
			}
			System.out.println(reverse.toString());
	
}
}


How to implement a stack which will support following operations in O(1) time complexity?
1) push() which adds an element to the top of stack.
2) pop() which removes an element from top of stack.
3) findMiddle() which will return middle element of the stack.
4) deleteMiddle() which will delete the middle element.
Push and pop are standard stack operations.

Very IMP Q -> Disadvantages of HashMap or Hashtable OR Why is BALANCED TREES better than using Hashtable

Very IMP Q -> Disadvantages of HashMap or Hashtable OR Why is BALANCED TREES better than using Hashtable
or HashMap?
Ans -> 
In short:
1) Requires more main memory
2) Hashing algorithm does not result in spatial locality. Because hash tables cause
access patterns that jump around, this can trigger microprocessor cache misses that cause long delays.
3) Similar key types will result in more collision and hence the hashtable would be more like a linkedlist.
Collisions also ruin memory utilization- if I have 70 elements in 100 buckets, but those 70 elements hash to 
only 4 buckets (and yes, Virginia, I’ve seen collision rates this bad), then 96 of my buckets aren’t doing
me any good at, I’m just wasting that space.
4) Occasionally HashMap/Hashtable requires resizing when the original size of HashMap/Hashtable buckets
are full. Resizing takes O(n) time as the elements from the previous hashtable/HashMap are transferred to
a new bigger Hashtable/HashMap. This is not good for implementation.
5) The concept that Hashtables/HashMap offers O(constant) (aka O(1) ) time complexity
for insertion, deletion and searchingis something to rethink on as the datastructure givies that
time complexity on a average scale, which is called as "AMORTIZED" time complexity. That means that there
would be atleast on instance out of n instances where the Time Complexity would be O(n) and not O(constant).
This is the time when the HashMap/Hashtable requires resizing.

Longest Common SubSequence Problem:
/*
Question: Find the longest common subsequence between two strings

Question and Answer Source: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-4-longest-common-subsequence/

Algortihm: 1. declare a matrix of s1.length()+1 and s2.length()+1.
              +1 is to store the results of the previous matches
           2. initialize row = 0 OR column = 0 to 0 which indicates that the previous matches was 0
           3. for i=1 to s1.length+1 
           		for j=1 to s2.length+1
           			if(s1.charAt(i-1)==s2.charAt(j-1))
           				dp[i][j]= dp[i-1][j-1]+1 // current match = previous match +1
