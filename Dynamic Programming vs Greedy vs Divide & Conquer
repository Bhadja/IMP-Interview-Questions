Divide & Conquer vs DP: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13538459/difference-between-divide-and-conquer-algo-and-dynamic-programming

Examples of Divide & Conquer:
SEARCHING ALGORITHM:
1.Binary Search
SORTING ALGORITHMS:
1. MergeSort
2. QuickSort

Examples of Dynamic Programming:
1. BellmanFord Algorithm for Single Source Shortest Path Calculation(It gives path from single source to all the other nodes)
2. Floyd Warshall Algorithm for All Pair Shorted Path Calculation(It gives path from all nodes to all other nodes)

Examples of Greedy:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm for Single Source Shortest Path Calculation(It gives path from single source to a single destination node)
2. Prim's Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree
3. Kruskal's Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree
(Difference between Prims and Kruskals Algorithm: http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-in-Kruskals-and-Prims-algorithm)
Given the differences, how is Kruskal's algorithm considered as a greedy approach ?
Ans. TODO
