What does recursion do ? And if given a choice between recursion and iteration, why should one choose iteration over recursion ?

Recursion is a method of solving problems based on the divide and conquer mentality. 
The basic idea is that you take the original problem and divide it into smaller (more easily solved) instances of itself,
solve those smaller instances (usually by using the same algorithm again) and then reassemble them into the final solution.
